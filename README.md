# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for analysis. We will be working with the COVID-19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. Additionally, we have another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are living in that country.

### Notes

- This project is designed for learners based in the North America region. We're currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.

## Project Objectives

1. **Importing COVID-19 Dataset:**
   - Import the COVID-19 dataset and prepare it for analysis by dropping unnecessary columns and aggregating rows.

2. **Calculating Measure:**
   - Decide on and calculate a suitable measure for our analysis.

3. **Merging Datasets:**
   - Merge the COVID-19 dataset with the life factors dataset.

4. **Finding Correlations:**
   - Find correlations among our data to understand any relationships between the spread of the virus and life factors.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the analysis results using Seaborn to gain insights into the data.

## Datasets

- **COVID-19 Dataset:** 
  - The COVID-19 dataset is published by John Hopkins University and contains information about the cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each country.

- **Life Factors Dataset:**
  - This dataset consists of various life factors scored by the people living in each country around the globe.

## Files

- `Dataset`: The COVID-19 dataset used for the analysis.
- `covid19 data analysis notebook (1).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis process.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Instructions

- Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook `COVID19_and_Life_Factors_Analysis.ipynb` to follow the analysis process step by step.
- Execute each cell in the notebook to import, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.
- Make sure to understand each step thoroughly to gain insights into the data and analysis process.

## Future Steps

- Extend the analysis to other regions to provide a similar learning experience for learners worldwide.
- Explore additional datasets to enrich the analysis and understand further factors affecting the spread of the virus and overall happiness levels.
